      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          The universe is vast, containing billions of galaxies and countless
          planets. However, we have yet to find any clear signs of
          extraterrestrial life. The Great Silence of the universe is one of the
          most perplexing questions that humanity is striving to answer.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Why is this silence a mystery?</h2>
      <section>
        <p>The absence of extraterrestrial signals raises many questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If life is common, why haven&apos;t we made contact with any
            civilizations?
          </li>
          <li>
            Could there be a barrier preventing civilizations from surviving
            long-term?
          </li>
          <li>Are we searching in the wrong way?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many theories have been proposed, from the Fermi Paradox and the Great
          Filter to the possibility that civilizations self-destruct before they
          can communicate.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The silence of the universe is not just a scientific mystery but also
          a question about humanity&apos;s fate. Continuing research and
          exploration will help us better understand our place in this vast
          cosmos.
