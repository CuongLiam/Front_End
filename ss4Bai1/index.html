          "For the past half-century, humanity has been listening for alien
          radio transmissions, but so far we appear to be the only ones
          broadcasting into the void. Astrobiologists now seek to narrow down
          the search by looking for other technological and biological
          signatures. In these websites, I explore some of the methods by which
          they hope to do so, and why the great silence of the universe is such
          a mystery".
